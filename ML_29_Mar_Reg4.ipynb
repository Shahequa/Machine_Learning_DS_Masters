    "`Ans) Lasso Regression, also known as L1 regularization, is a type of linear regression technique that uses a penalty term to shrink the magnitude of the coefficients towards zero. It differs from other regression techniques, such as ordinary least squares regression and Ridge regression, by imposing a constraint on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients.`\n",

    "`Ans) The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is that it can effectively perform variable selection by shrinking the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero. This is because Lasso Regression uses L1 regularization, which adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients, resulting in sparse solutions with many coefficients equal to zero. In contrast, other regression techniques like Ridge Regression or ordinary least squares regression do not perform variable selection, as they only shrink the coefficients towards zero, but not to exactly zero. Thus, Lasso Regression can be very useful when dealing with high-dimensional data with many irrelevant features, as it allows for a more parsimonious and interpretable model with only the relevant features included.`"

However, the key difference is that Lasso Regression can produce sparse models by setting some of the coefficients to zero, effectively eliminating some predictor variables from the model.`\n",
