    "\n",
    "#### Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data, instead of the underlying patterns. This can result in a model that is too complex and has poor generalization performance on new, unseen data. In other words, the model memorizes the training data instead of learning the underlying pattern and fails to generalize well on new data. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Some consequences of overfitting include a high variance in the model, poor accuracy on new data, and increased complexity. Overfitting can be caused by using a complex model with too many features or by training a model for too long on a small dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    To mitigate overfitting, some strategies include using a simpler model with fewer features, increasing the amount of training data, or using regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization or dropout.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Underfitting:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and testing data. In other words, the model is too simple to capture the true underlying relationship between the input features and output targets. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Some consequences of underfitting include a high bias in the model, poor accuracy on both training and testing data, and a lack of complexity. Underfitting can be caused by using a model with too few features or by not training the model for long enough. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    To mitigate underfitting, some strategies include using a more complex model with more features, increasing the training time, or using more advanced optimization techniques.\n",

    "`In general, finding the right balance between overfitting and underfitting is important in machine learning. The goal is to create a model that is complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data but not too complex that it overfits to the training data. This can be achieved by using techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, and early stopping.`"

    "    Visual Inspection: One of the simplest methods is to visualize the performance of the model on the training and validation data. If the model performs well on the training data but poorly on the validation data, it may be overfitting. If the model performs poorly on both training and validation data, it may be underfitting.\n",

A learning curve plots the performance of the model on the training and validation data as a function of the training set size.

If the model is underfitting, both training and validation performance will plateau or converge to a suboptimal level.\n",
