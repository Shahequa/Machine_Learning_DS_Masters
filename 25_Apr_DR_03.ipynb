    "\n",
    "In simple terms, eigenvectors are special vectors that do not change their direction when a linear transformation is applied to them. Eigenvalues, on the other hand, are scalar values associated with eigenvectors that represent the scaling factor by which the eigenvectors are stretched or compressed under the linear transformation.\n",

    "The eigen-decomposition approach is a technique used to decompose a square matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This decomposition allows us to understand how the linear transformation defined by the matrix affects different directions in the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example to illustrate these concepts. Suppose we have a 2x2 matrix A:\n",
    "\n",
    "A = [[2, 1],\n",
    "     [1, 2]]\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A, we solve the eigenvalue equation:\n",

    "By solving this equation, we find that the eigenvalues of matrix A are λ1 = 3 and λ2 = 1. \n",

    "\n",
    "(A - λ * I) * v = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "where I is the identity matrix.\n",
    "\n",

    "Ans) Eigen decomposition, also known as eigendecomposition, is a fundamental concept in linear algebra that decomposes a square matrix into a set of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors. It is represented by the equation:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors: Eigen decomposition allows us to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix, which provide important insights into the properties and behavior of the matrix. Eigenvalues represent the scaling factors associated with the eigenvectors, while eigenvectors represent the directions along which the matrix has a simple scaling effect.\n",

    "3. Matrix powers and exponentiation: Eigen decomposition simplifies calculations involving matrix powers and exponentiation. By expressing a matrix as A = V * Λ * V^-1, we can easily raise it to a power or compute its exponential by performing operations on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n",

    "Ans) For a square matrix A to be diagonalizable using eigen-decomposition, it must satisfy the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Algebraic multiplicity equals geometric multiplicity: The algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue λ is the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial of A, while the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the corresponding eigenspace. For A to be diagonalizable, the algebraic multiplicity and geometric multiplicity must be equal for each eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let λ be an eigenvalue of A with algebraic multiplicity m and geometric multiplicity g. This means that there exist g linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue λ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the eigenvectors v1, v2, ..., vg associated with λ. Since they are linearly independent, they span a subspace of dimension g.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's extend this set of eigenvectors to a basis for the entire vector space. We can add vectors w1, w2, ..., wk to this set such that v1, v2, ..., vg, w1, w2, ..., wk form a basis for the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a matrix V whose columns are the vectors v1, v2, ..., vg, w1, w2, ..., wk. V is invertible since its columns form a basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider the matrix B = V^(-1) * A * V. Since V is invertible, B is similar to A, meaning they have the same eigenvalues. Let's look at the structure of B:\n",
    "\n",
    "          [λ1     0    ...   0]\n",

    "\n",
    "Since A and B have the same eigenvalues, A is also diagonalizable, with V being the matrix of eigenvectors and Λ being the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Matrix is not defective: A matrix is defective if it does not have a sufficient number of linearly independent eigenvectors to form a basis for the vector space. If a matrix is defective, it cannot be diagonalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "If A is defective, it means that there exists an eigenvalue λ with algebraic multiplicity m and geometric multiplicity g, where m > g. In other words, there are not enough linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to λ to form a basis for the vector space.\n",

    "Ans) The spectral theorem is a very important concept in linear algebra that is closely related to the eigen-decomposition approach. It tells us that under certain conditions, a square matrix can be diagonalized, which means it can be simplified into a diagonal matrix.\n",

Now, the spectral theorem tells us that if this matrix satisfies some special conditions, we can break it down into simpler pieces.\n",

This means we can simplify the puzzle by rearranging the pieces in a way that all the numbers are on the main diagonal of the matrix, and the other positions are filled with zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of the spectral theorem is that it allows us to understand the original matrix in a much simpler way. The diagonalized matrix is easier to work with and reveals important information about the transformation it represents. The eigenvalues on the diagonal tell us how the space is scaled or stretched along different directions, and the eigenvectors tell us the directions of those stretches.\n",

The spectral theorem tells us that we can find two orthogonal eigenvectors and their corresponding eigenvalues. These eigenvectors will represent the directions of stretching, and the eigenvalues will tell us the scale of the stretching along those directions.\n",
