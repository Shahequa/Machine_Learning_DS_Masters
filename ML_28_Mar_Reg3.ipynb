    "`Ans) Ridge regression is a regularized linear regression technique that is used to prevent overfitting in the model. It adds a penalty term to the cost function of the ordinary least squares regression, which is based on the sum of the squared residuals. The penalty term is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients, multiplied by a tuning parameter called the regularization parameter or lambda. This penalty term helps to reduce the magnitudes of the coefficients, and in turn, reduces the variance in the model.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`The key difference between Ridge regression and ordinary least squares regression is the addition of the penalty term. In ordinary least squares regression, the objective is to minimize the sum of the squared residuals, without any constraint on the size of the coefficients. However, in Ridge regression, the objective is to minimize the sum of the squared residuals and the penalty term, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. This penalty term encourages the model to have smaller coefficients, which can help to reduce overfitting.`\n",

    "`In Ridge regression, the tuning parameter lambda controls the strength of the penalty term. A smaller value of lambda results in a weaker penalty, and the model becomes more like ordinary least squares regression. On the other hand, a larger value of lambda results in a stronger penalty, and the model becomes more constrained, leading to smaller coefficient values.`\n",

    "`Ans) Ridge regression can be helpful in handling multicollinearity in the data, as it introduces a bias in the estimation of the regression coefficients that can reduce the impact of highly correlated predictor variables. When there is multicollinearity in the data, the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator can become unstable and highly sensitive to small changes in the data, leading to unreliable results. Ridge regression reduces the variance of the estimator by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which shrinks the regression coefficients towards zero and helps to reduce the impact of multicollinearity on the estimation process.`\n",

    "`However, it is important to note that Ridge regression may not completely solve the problem of multicollinearity, especially if the degree of correlation between the predictor variables is very high. In some cases, it may be necessary to use other techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) or partial least squares regression (PLS) to reduce the number of predictor variables and avoid overfitting. Additionally, Ridge regression assumes that all the predictor variables are relevant for the outcome variable, which may not always be the case in practice. In such cases, feature selection techniques can be used to identify the most important predictors and exclude the irrelevant ones from the model.`"
